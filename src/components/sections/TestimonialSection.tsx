They have taken away all the stress and worry and have taken away all of the painful paperwork (which is a minefield on our hands. They explain the full process that flight and what it's like for the pets and calmed me down when I was too worried. Just incredible all around. They work very closely with Emirates and updated the airline about our deaf friend girl which then continued to Emirates who then updated us about our pets and gave us the temperature of their hold space (26¬∞C ha!)`,

We just want to send you all a big THANK YOU to Haven Vets and Pet Air for the amazing service and care that went into safely getting Tilly home to South Africa.

We want to thank Susie, Tilly's vet, the girls and all at Haven Vets (Llanelli) for the care you gave to preparing Tilly for her travels.

We want to thank Corinne and all at Pet Air for who took care in arranging her safe travels home to South Africa.
